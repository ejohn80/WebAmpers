# WebAmp

WebAmp is a web-based application that lets users process audio files or live recordings instantly by applying and stacking customizable sound effects such as noise gates, overdrive, delay, phaser, and chorus. It supports importing and exporting audio in formats like WAV, MP3, and MIDI, includes user accounts with cloud saving, and allows real-time recording and playback with effects. Users can edit audio through trimming, merging, and copying, while version control ensures continuous saving and easy rollback of changes. Dynamic waveform and spectrum visualizations provide intuitive feedback as users shape their sound.

The goal is to create an accessible and free browser-based audio processing service that can be used for general purposes such as trimming audio recordings or more specialized uses such as music production.
