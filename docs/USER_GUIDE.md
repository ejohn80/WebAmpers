# WebAmp User Guide

## 1. What is WebAmp and why would I use it?
WebAmp is an in-browser audio editor. You can:
- Record yourself (voice, guitar, etc.).
- Cut out mistakes.
- Boost or reduce volume in specific regions.
- Add basic audio effects (increase pitch, noise cleanup).
- Export the final audio as a single file.

You do **not** need to install desktop DAW software. WebAmp was made to be for anyone who needs to produce a fast audio track.
