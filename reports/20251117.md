## Team Report:

### Last week's goals:

- Fix all the bugs with effects
- Add more effects (currently only have 3)
- Finish backend for exporting non-wav file formats
- Implement multi-track, or at least multiple assets per track
- Implement selector for different tracks
- Work on trimming
- Refine styling so it more closely matches the figma prototype
- Effects rework

### Progress and Issues:

- Effects now work when exported
- Added delay, bass boost, distortion effects
- Started work on multi-track/asset functionality
- Reworked footer
- Working on adding a menu for users to select which effects they want to add

### Plans and goals for the next week:

- Continue working on multi-track/asset functionality (highest priority)
- Remaking audio engine
- This includes reworking other parts of code to work with multi-track/asset
- Continue working on trimming
- Add even more effects
- Continue working on effects menu

## Contributions of individual team members:

### Zahara:

#### Last Week’s Goals:

- Continue with finalizing the footer and ensure there are no bugs, and resolve cross-browser rendering inconsistencies
- Collaborate with teammates to see if any additional UI components are needed for the main content area and design them if so
- Refine styling for the track buttons and effects tab to more closely match the Figma prototype and improve overall layout consistency

#### Progress and Issues:

- Fixed issue where adding effects would slow down the rest of the effects sliders by having effects apply only when the user releases the notch
  - Slider responsiveness is more smooth
- Added an individual reset button for each effect and a ‘reset all’ button
  - Users can now quickly revert changes without affecting all of the effects
- Started working on an ‘add effects’ button to open a menu for users to select which effects to add
  - Menu improves user control

#### Plans and goals for the next week:

- Update the menu to include any newly added effects (1 day)
- Refine the menu UI and ensure it displays correctly across different browsers (1 day)
- Implement functionality: clicking an effect adds it to the left sidebar (1-2 days)
  - Test adding multiple effects at once
- Add an “X” button to each effect tab for deleting unneeded effects (1 day)

### Jiarong:

#### Last week's goals:

- Implement functionality for each of the audio effects
- Refactor code to support multitracks

#### Progress and Issues:

- Successfully extended the audio track, making its length based on the audio duration rather than a fixed value.
- Fix some bug in the playback engine

#### Plans and goals for the next week:

- Think and discuss how to cut audio
- Implement the cut function.

### Tomas:

#### Last week's goals:

- Fix any bugs with adding effects (currently effects are not saved, and are glitchy)
- Add more effects
- Connect the gap between assets uploaded locally (no-account) and the firebase ones (account)
- Add backend exporting (inherited from last week)

#### Progress and Issues:

- Fixed effects so that they are reflected when exported
- Added delay, bass boost, and distortion effects
- Started working with backend exporting, not 100% complete.
- Have the firebase asset uploads, but not merged with main

#### Plans and goals for the next week:

- Finish backend exporting (need frontend to direct to api endpoint instead of local server)
- Continue working on multi-track and multiple assets per track functionality (Ethan has started)
- Add more effects
- Help to fix the Peer review bugs if needed

### Long (Updated November 17, 2025):

#### Last week's goals:

- Fixing what we missed based on TA feedback (Finished when TA’s send feedback)
- Updating UI to fit Figma (Expected this and next week)
- Pick up functionality on either Tools or more Audio effects

#### Progress and Issues:

- Tools picked up by Jiarong
- UI picked up by Zaharra
- Updated top-level readme, USER_GUIDE, DEVELOPER_GUIDE to meet TA requirements

#### Plans and goals for the next week:

- AFTER Peer reviews, fix new issues from peers (End of week)
- Expected audio engine rework after Tuesday's meeting. Help where is needed (Unsure how long this will take)
- If this is all picked up by someone else, buttons at the header which currently contain no functionality should be implemented.

### Yiwen:

#### Last week's goals:

- Remaking effects (all week)
  - Track specific (no effects shown if no tracks are selected)
  - Options (user picks which effects to include instead of default preset)

#### Progress and Issues:

- Remaking effects (on hold). This has been postponed to wait for a rework of the audio engine. Currently, new effects features and new UI have been worked on by other members.
- Added global context for tracks
  - Makes red bar relative to the main context window instead of track by track
  - Added a global context timer bar
  - Tracks are displayed proportionally to each other
- Added tests for exporting audio with effects
- Updated schedule for what has been completed

#### Plans and goals for the next week:

- Remaking audio engine (Wednesday)
- Refining Track display (Friday)
- Remaking effects (Sunday stretch)
  - Track specific (no effects shown if no tracks are selected)
  - Options (user picks which effects to include instead of default preset)

### Ethan:

#### Last week goals:

- Review any current pull requests, offer feedback, and merge with main if everything looks good. Finish by Monday 11/10 EOD, such that there are no pull requests that have no feedback or have not been merged to main.
- Look into how the multi-track feature will work and implement this functionality into a new working branch by the next team meeting on Thursday 11/13.
- Write automated tests for multi-track implementation by Friday 11/14 EOD.

#### Progress and Issues:

- I have the multi-track functionality implemented into its own branch but there are a few new bugs that need to be fixed.
- The multi-track implementation adds a lot of interactions with other parts of code, which likely needs to be discussed and reworked. This might lead to a lot more work, especially in addition to potential audio engine reworking.

#### Plans and goals for the next week:

- Finish fixing bugs from multi-track implementation before the group meeting on Tuesday 11/18.
- Modify additional parts of the code to meet the group’s expectations of interactions with multi-tracks. Finish before the group meeting on Thursday 11/20 after hearing feedback on the current multi-track functionality on Tuesday.
- Help review any pull requests made for this week by other group members. Finish within a day of them coming up.
