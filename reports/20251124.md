## Team Report:

### Last week's goals:
- Continue working on multi-track/asset functionality (highest priority)
- Remaking audio engine
- This includes reworking other parts of code to work with multi-track/asset
- Continue working on trimming
- Add even more effects
- Finalize effects menu

### Progress and Issues:
- Multi-track implemented and correctly plays and exports both tracks
- Exporting works for all file types on the hosted website (used to be only WAV), still has some bugs
- Fullscreen feature
- Working on file editing like trimming, copying, deleting…
- Menu UI and functionality is mostly complete

### Plans and goals for the next week:
- Debugging
- Implement multiple segment per track functionality
- Work on individual segment effects rather than global ones
- Finalize adding menu which allows users to select which effects are shown in left sidebar
- Adjust styling for tracks


## Contributions of individual team members:

### Zahara:
#### Last Week’s Goals:
- Update the menu to include any newly added effects
- Refine the menu UI and ensure it displays correctly across different browsers
- Implement functionality: clicking an effect adds it to the left sidebar
  - Test adding multiple effects at once
- Add an “X” button to each effect tab for deleting unneeded effects

#### Progress and Issues:
- Updated the menu to include newly added effects
  - The new menu improves organization and makes it easier for users to browse available effects
  - Will review ordering for best usability (likely alphabetical order)
- Menu UI is visually consistent and looks good across major browsers
- Effects can now be added and removed from the sidebar, but need more testing to ensure no bugs

#### Plans and goals for the next week:
  - Add a toggle switch for each individual effect to turn them on/off, plus a master switch for toggling all effects (2 days)
  - Refine UI styling for track controls and button components (2 days)
  - Make styling adjustments across the app to match the Figma prototype more closely (1 day)
  - Begin adding a light mode theme (2 days)


### Jiarong:
#### Last week's goals:
-  Think and discuss how to cut audio
-   Implement the cut function.

#### Progress and Issues:
- Still working on the trimming & cutting function, having bugs on the sliding handle to select the region that I want to trim/cut.
- Think of how the trim/cut will look like and the UI with it. We need to discuss it and may change it after I complete the function.

#### Plans and goals for the next week:
- Implement the cut and trim function.
- Make those functions apply to single track not only for all the tracks that are imported.


### Tomas:
#### Last week's goals:
- Finish backend exporting (need frontend to direct to api endpoint instead of local server)
- Continue working on multi-track and multiple assets per track functionality (Ethan has started)
- Add more effects
- Help to fix the Peer review bugs if needed

#### Progress and Issues:
- Containerized our backend and deployed it.
- Exporting now works for all file formats on the hosted websites, but still running into some issues with file sizes (sometimes get 413 [too big]), CORS, and long processing times (~40s for 3min audio).
- Added fullscreen functionality
- Added 6 more effects
- Fixed some bugs that got merged with the multi-track pull request
- Fixed some peer-review issues

#### Plans and goals for the next week:
- Handle the exporting bugs + including 1 peer review
- Rework the saving system as we’re kind of moving towards saving everything locally. Need to change how “projects” work, how assets are fetched and displayed
- Help out with individual “segment” effects, not global
- Implement a dedicated Equalizer (peer requested feature), depending on how on-track we are on other parts of the project


### Long (Updated November 17, 2025):

#### Last week's goals:
- AFTER Peer reviews, fix new issues from peers (End of week)
- Expected audio engine rework after Tuesday's meeting. Help where is needed (Unsure how long this will take)
- If this is all picked up by someone else, buttons at the header which currently contain no functionality should be implemented.

#### Progress and Issues:
- Added live follow track feature
- Added right click options for track
- All issues were addressed as a team from peer review
- Prepared materials for recording demo

#### Plans and goals for the next week:
- Record demo

### Yiwen:
#### Last week's goals:
- Remaking audio engine (Wednesday)
- Refining Track display (Friday)
- Remaking effects (Sunday stretch)
  - Track specific (no effects shown if no tracks are selected)
  - Options (user picks which effects to include instead of default preset)

#### Progress and Issues:
- Remaking audio engine (On hold. Needs coordination with team. Potentially dropping since we’re not sure how necessary this is)
- Refining Track display (pushed back, prioritizing other features), might need effects to be completed
- Remaking effects (In progress)
- Added local project session
  - users can create different project states
  - all saved on browser so we need to think about how to handle data overload
- Added Assets
  - No login is required to access the asset tab anymore
 - Imported audio are in assets and can be reused

#### Plans and goals for the next week:
- Debugging (All week)
  - Fixing known bugs
  - Adding more tests
  - Potentially disco
- Remaking effects (All week)
  - Track specific (no effects shown if no tracks are selected)
  - Options (user picks which effects to include instead of default preset)

### Ethan:
#### Last week goals:
- Finish fixing bugs from multi-track implementation before the group meeting on Tuesday 11/18.
- Modify additional parts of the code to meet the group’s expectations of interactions with multi-tracks. Finish before the group meeting on Thursday 11/20 after hearing feedback on the current multi-track functionality on Tuesday.
- Help review any pull requests made for this week by other group members. Finish within a day of them coming up.

#### Progress and Issues:
- Multi-track is functional and pushed to main but there are still a few issues that need to be resolved. This has created a lot more work and a lot more potential for features that we can add as according to our planned goals.
- Since more effects have been added, there is even more motivation for reworking the audio engine, but this will require that nobody work on it but the majority of features to be added need to interact with the audio engine in some way. 


#### Plans and goals for the next week:
- Finish the implementation of singular tracks able to be selected and the ability to apply effects to only singular tracks rather than overall effects options. Finish this by EOD Tuesday 11/25.
- Help review any pull requests made for this week by other group members. Finish within a day of them coming up.
- Look into optimizations that can be made towards exporting and applying effects and add/modify the code for these updates. Finish this by EOD Thursday 11/27. Looking into optimizations for parts of the export code and effect applications will probably take around a day and implementing these changes will likely take another day.
- Implement the ability to drag tracks from assets into the main content area. Finish this by EOD Friday 11/28.
