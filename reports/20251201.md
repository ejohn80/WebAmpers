## Team Report:

### Last week's goals:
- Debugging
- Implement multiple segment per track functionality

- Finalize adding menu which allows users to select which effects are shown in left sidebar
- Adjust styling for tracks

### Progress and Issues:
- Finished individual segment effects
- Adjusted track styling
- Cut/Trim functionality (In PR)
- Equalizer → tool (PR tomorrow)

### Plans and goals for the next week:
- Implement multiple segment per track functionality
- Add ability to move the segments within the track
- Fix everything with exporting files
- Debugging
- Save a snapshot of IndexDB to firebase

## Contributions of individual team members:

### Zahara:
#### Last Week’s Goals:
  - Add a toggle switch for each individual effect to turn them on/off, plus a master switch for toggling all effects
  - Refine UI styling for track controls and button components
  - Make styling adjustments across the app to match the Figma prototype more closely

#### Progress and Issues:
- Added individual and master toggle switches
  - Works fine but need to make sure there are no bugs across different sessions and tracks and edgecases
- Added a delete all button that deletes every effect
  - Simplifies deleting effects for users
- Styling improvements to effects tab

#### Plans and goals for the next week:
- Finalize individual and master toggle switches (1-2 days)
-  Refine UI styling for track controls and button components (1-2 days)
-  Add a light mode theme if there is time and nothing more important needs to be done (1-2 days)




### Jiarong:
#### Last week's goals:
- Implement the cut and trim function.
- Make those functions apply to single track not only for all the tracks that are imported.

#### Progress and Issues:
- Finish implementing the cut and trim function, able to use it on a single track.
- Fixed some bug there exist with the new codes
#### Plans and goals for the next week:
- Work on “undo” function (if there’s time) -> a function that can undo trim/cut operations
- Be ready for the final release


### Tomas:
#### Last week's goals:
- Handle the exporting bugs + including 1 peer review
- Rework the saving system as we’re kind of moving towards saving everything locally. Need to change how “projects” work, how assets are fetched and displayed
- Help out with individual “segment” effects, not global
- Implement a dedicated Equalizer (peer requested feature), depending on how on-track we are on other parts of the project

#### Progress and Issues:
- Fixed some issues that were added from the latest merges (#73, #74)
- Implement a dedicated Equalizer (One of the tools), still need to raise PR
- Working on save/load feature where we would be uploading user state (effects, tracks, files) to firebase so user could go back to previous version and also access it on different browser (now index-based)
- Exporting has quite a few issues because the file sizes are often larger than 32MB, which drops 413 error, no easy solution. I’m thinking of moving the mp3 to use another encoder library, and OGG would be sent with a lower bitrate.

#### Plans and goals for the next week:
- Finish exporting
- Finish saving → Will scrap it if too hard as local storage is good enough


### Long (Updated November 17, 2025):

#### Last week's goals:
- Record demo

#### Progress and Issues:
- Finished recording

#### Plans and goals for the next week:
- Add final tests 
- Fix all linting issues
- Finish anything additionally needed for the final release

### Yiwen:
#### Last week's goals:
- Debugging (All week)
  - Fixing known bugs
  - Adding more tests
  - Potentially discovering more
- Remaking effects (All week)
  - Track specific (no effects shown if no tracks are selected)
  - Options (user picks which effects to include instead of default preset)

#### Progress and Issues:
- Debugging
  - Remade the waveform rendering to accommodate longer audio. Before it failed to display due to large canvas size
  - Fixed issues with saving states
  - Remade the zoom feature to stretch the waveform horizontally
  - Removed unnecessary space/padding on the track component
- Remaking effects (This task completed by other members)

#### Plans and goals for the next week:
- Multiple audio segments (major feature to be done by Friday)
- Debugging (All week)
  - Addressing git issues
  - Fixing major bugs before release
- Remaking the audio controls for the track (stretch)


### Ethan:
#### Last week goals:
- Finish the implementation of singular tracks able to be selected and the ability to apply effects to only singular tracks rather than overall effects options. Finish this by EOD Tuesday 11/25.
- Help review any pull requests made for this week by other group members. Finish within a day of them coming up.
- Look into optimizations that can be made towards exporting and applying effects and add/modify the code for these updates. Finish this by EOD Thursday 11/27. Looking into optimizations for parts of the export code and effect applications will probably take around a day and implementing these changes will likely take another day.
- Implement the ability to drag tracks from assets into the main content area. Finish this by EOD Friday 11/28.

#### Progress and Issues:
- The feature of being able to select individual tracks and apply effects to those tracks took a lot longer than expected to implement. This feature took multiple iterations and different kinds of approaches to get to a fully functional version. In this form, it has been merged, but as a result of it taking longer than expected, I have not been able to work on the other goals that I listed from the previous week.
- Dragging tracks from assets to the main content area was completed by another group member with the implementation of sessions.
- Did not get started on looking into optimizations, which can be moved to something that I can look into further this week. While another group member is planned to have been working on this, it is probably best to get multiple people working on it to make the workflow of the web app to be much smoother than it currently is.

#### Plans and goals for the next week:
- Help review any pull requests made for this week by other group members. Finish within a day of them coming up.
- Look into resolving all of the issues listed in the Github page before the meeting on Tuesday 12/2.
- Help with any final features that need to be added if there is anything else we decide we need to add. Discuss this at the team meeting on Tuesday, 12/2, and finish anything that needs to be completed by EOD Friday 12/5.
- Look into optimizations that can be made towards exporting and applying effects and add/modify the code for these updates. Finish this by EOD Wednesday 12/3. Looking into optimizations for parts of the export code and effect applications will probably take around a day and implementing these changes will likely take another day.
