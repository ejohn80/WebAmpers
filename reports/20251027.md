## Contributions of individual team members:


### Zahara:
#### Last Week’s Goals: 
- Finalize UI mockup on Figma
- Begin front-end development based on finalized prototype
- Organize figma assets and export them for development

#### Progress and Issues:
- Figma assets ready for development
- Began implementing dropdown menu functionality in header
- Encountered minor CSS alignment issues

#### Plans and goals for the next week:
- Finalize and refine header and dropdown functionality (2 days)
- Continue integrating core UI components into layout (1 day)
- Test and polish user interactions (1 day)
- Work on implementing playback controls (start/pause/resume) (2-3 days)


### Jiarong:
#### Last week's goals:
-  Study tone.js and write the code to ensure that our web page can play audio by the end of the week
- Help design version control system with frontend, done by the end of Thursday.
#### Progress and Issues:
- Finishing coding the playback for the web, trying to debug it
- working/discussing where to store user’s work

#### Plans and goals for the next week:
- Integrating Python with the JS code in the audio manager by the end of friday
-  Integration with storage like Firebase by the end of the week
	– Upload, Delete, Save, Open/select


### Tomas:
#### Last week's goals:
- Finish Upload/Delete/Save/Open functionalities (to actually save it to the database)
- Help with UI (reactful/state components)
- Set up a basic container in Google Cloud, and try to invoke a simple function like print hello world from the front end.

#### Progress and Issues:
- Created functionality for creating and fetching user projects (saves it in the database). A lot of groundwork for then saving user uploaded files (assets).
- Worked on UI, mainly on the sidebar that has the projects, assets, and effects tabs.
- Started working on the API. Tried setting up docker on my Windows pc, ran into some system issues. I had to reinstall it on my mac, then needed to set up a lot of Google cloud account settings. Got it running, now it simply returns “hello world”, but is published online.

#### Plans and goals for the next week:
- Finish everything with user upload + project saving state (~60% done)
- Work on the header (displaying project name, account settings, project settings…)
- Finish working on the side bar (finishing up the styles, adding effect controls…)


### Long (Updated October 27, 2025):

#### Last week's goals:
- Test appropriate any features expected to be setup by other team members
- Finish testing documentation (Testing and CI assignment). Documentation includes details for testing and how to use. (End of week)
- Support front-end or begin creating Audio Effects with tone.js. (End of week or moves into the following week)


#### Progress and Issues:
- Not many features required testing this week
- Other members were working on front-end
- This week finished setting up CI using Github Actions
- Finished testing documentation
- Setup ESLint, & Prettier
- Changed remaining Jest tests to Vitest
- Finished Implementation & Documentation assignment (Update README.md, added USER_GUIDE.md, added DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md)

#### Plans and goals for the next week:
- Add audio effects
- Look into storing audio files in browser
- Experiment how to change audio track with audio effects


### Yiwen:
#### Last week's goals:
- Finalize Design (Tuesday as a team)
- Update schedule/tasks (Tuesday)
- Write more tests for file import in consideration of more supported files (Tuesday)
- Testing audio visualization (Thursday)
- Implement buttons for audio editor (Friday)
  - May include implementation of logic for record/playback
  - Connecting ui components to already implemented logic
  - Discussing ui designs with team members

#### Progress and Issues:
- Finished Design. I tried to make it as comprehensive as possible to have it as an implementation guide for team members. But I’m not confident how effective my proposed design works. 
- Updated schedule to include tasks completed and incorporated milestones. We are surprisingly mostly on track with our original proposed schedule. 
- Adjusted AudioImporter to support more files and included new tests
- Wrote data storage models for storing and organizing audio tracks and segments
  - Included refactoring code to work with these new data objects
- Unfinished
  - Testing audio visualization (Since track ui is not completely implemented this is on hold)
  - Implementing buttons (Task passed to other members)

#### Plans and goals for the next week:
- Implementing browser memory storage of data (Wednesday)
- Helping and finishing playback implementation (Thursday)
- Reimplementing waveform rendering so it looks nicer (Friday)


### Ethan:
#### Last week goals:
- Rewrite tests from Jest to Vitest for the AudioImporter such that all the tests still pass and maintain the same functionality. Finish by EOD Tuesday 10/21, and should only take 2 hours at most.
- Help with implementation of audio recording so that a user can press the record button and record their audio, resulting in a new audio file being created. Finish by Wednesday 10/22, should take 1-2 days looking into any helpful Tone.js methods and how to save the audio file.
- Write tests for audio recording ensuring that the file is properly saved when the recording ends, that the audio is recorded correctly with no distortions, and that. Finish by EOD Thursday, 10/23, as this should only take 1 day to complete.
- Look into the live mode feature and help with implementation so that there can be simultaneous recording and playback by EOD Friday 10/24, but may take longer to prevent conflicts between recording and playback, and looking into Tone.js for helpful methods. This task should take 1-2 days to complete.


#### Progress and Issues:
- Shifted from working on recording audio features to working on export audio and Python/JS integration, so did not end up working on the recording audio feature.
- Additionally, since time was not spent working on recording, I also did not work on or look into the live mode feature.
- Nearly finished with the work from last week with export audio and Python/JS integration but need more time than expected to finish it.

#### Plans and goals for the next week:
- Finish export and Python/JS integration files along with the testing code, ensuring that all tests pass to be able to submit a pull request before the team meeting on 10/28. Should take another day to completely finish such that a pull request can be made before the team meeting on Tuesday.
- Help with implementation of audio recording so that a user can press the record button and record their audio, resulting in a new audio file being created. Finish by Wednesday 10/29, should take 1-2 days looking into any helpful Tone.js methods and how to save the audio file.
- Write tests for audio recording ensuring that the file is properly saved when the recording ends, that the audio is recorded correctly with no distortions, and that. Finish by EOD Thursday, 10/30, as this should only take 1 day to complete.
