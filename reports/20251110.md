## Team Report:

### Last week's goals:
- Debugging and integrating branches for beta
- Implementing state handlers for audio effects
- Finish setting up knob/slider for effect parameters
- Implement functionality for each of the audio effects (could mean manual audio processing or using tone.js API)
- Testing audio effects
- Work on backend to finish a simple export function, maybe file conversion
- Debugging and implementing volume controls
- Refine footer UI and master volume logic

### Progress and Issues:
- UI is finished, but can still be incrementally improved
- Audio effects work, but are a little glitchy and currently are not attached to the audio buffers when exporting
- Issue with inconsistent styling across different web browsers
- Playback buttons look and feel more refined, included the addition of a new button that allows users to skip to the end of a track.

### Plans and goals for the next week:
- Fix all the bugs with effects
- Add more effects (currently only have 3)
- Finish backend for exporting non-wav file formats
- Implement multi-track, or at least multiple assets per track
- Implement selector for different tracks
- Work on trimming
- Refine styling so it more closely matches the figma prototype
- Effects rework

## Contributions of individual team members:


### Zahara:
#### Last Week’s Goals:
- Finalize styling for any audio or playback-related features (1-2 days)
- Make header and dropdown components functional (3 days)
- Finalize footer styling (1 day)

#### Progress and Issues:
- While working on the footer stylizing, encountered and fixed several bugs such as track muting behavior and layout inconsistencies
- Improved the master volume slider with additional styling and added more volume logic
- Added a playback button that correctly jumps to the end of the song and tested its behavior
- Implemented keyboard hotkeys for volume control
- Ran into an issue with inconsistent styling across different web browsers


#### Plans and goals for the next week:
- Continue with finalizing the footer and ensure there are no bugs, and resolve cross-browser rendering inconsistencies  (1-2 days)
- Collaborate with teammates to see if any additional UI components are needed for the main content area and design them if so (1 day)
- Refine styling for the track buttons and effects tab to more closely match the Figma prototype and improve overall layout consistency (2-3 days)


### Jiarong:
#### Last week's goals:
-  Add more features to the website (such as musical instruments, more effects).
-  Implement functionality for each of the audio effects

#### Progress and Issues:
- Enriching audio track functionality (debugging)
	- Extend the audio track so users can find the part they want. 
- The audio track can slide automatically. 
- Control the audio track using the blend wheel or a slider.

#### Plans and goals for the next week:
- Implement functionality for each of the audio effects
- Refactor code to support multitracks


### Tomas:
#### Last week's goals:
- Work on backend to finish a simple export function, maybe file conversion
- Integrate effects with state (large, high priority task)

#### Progress and Issues:
- Started working on integrating effects with state, but ran into many many bugs. I neither built the wavelength display nor the playback engine so I was a little bit out of the loop with how all the components interact. A teammate implemented effects, but it is somewhat glitchy and not persistent when exporting.
- Implemented the mock for multi-track display, not functional.

#### Plans and goals for the next week:
- Fix any bugs with adding effects (currently effects are not saved, and are glitchy)
- Add more effects
- Connect the gap between assets uploaded locally (no-account) and the firebase ones (account)
- Add backend exporting (inherited from last week)


### Long (Updated October 27, 2025):

#### Last week's goals:
- Finalize Footer UI (Finish before Tuesday for beta)
- Work on the main content page to space audio tracks. (End of week)

#### Progress and Issues:
- Preparing content for beta release 
- Fixing what we missed based on TA feedback (Finished when TA’s send feedback)
- Finalized footer (Finished before beta)
- Main content was picked up by someone else

#### Plans and goals for the next week:
- Updating UI to fit Figma (Expected this and next week)
- Pick up functionality on either Tools or more Audio effects


### Yiwen:
#### Last week's goals:
- Final debugging for beta (Tuesday)
- Slides prepping (Tuesday)
- Implementing track specific gain controls (Friday)
- Begin planning how to integrate audio effects (Friday)

#### Progress and Issues:
- Debugged mute/solo controls
- Added hotkeys for playback
- Connected audio effects ui with the engine (organizing which engine is associated with which effects and ensuring they are connected can be difficult when we add more features in the future. A reword of the playback engine is potentially necessary)

#### Plans and goals for the next week:
- Remaking effects (all week)
  - Track specific (no effects shown if no tracks are selected)
  - Options (user picks which effects to include instead of default preset)

### Ethan:
#### Last week goals:
- Help prepare for a beta release by integrating exporting into the beta release with all of the other features. Assist wherever is necessary according to what is buggy and what has yet to be integrated. To be completed by Tuesday 11/4 EOD.
- Review incoming pull requests for the different feature branches, ensure functionality, passing tests, and resolve any merge conflicts. Ideally, have it done by EOD Monday 11/3 so that the main branch is prepared with all of the current features for the beta release for discussion on Tuesday 11/4.
- Help make slides and potentially the demo for the beta presentation by Tuesday 11/4 EOD. 
- Look into more effects to determine what should be added and how to implement them, with the added effects being added by Friday 11/7 EOD.

#### Progress and Issues:
- Based on what we currently have working, we might need to reimplement the audio engine to be more understandable and to make it so that it fits with our current expectations and ideas on future interactions with the audio engine. However, changing the audio engine might lead to changing the logic of some other components which might need more attention than multi-tracks, leading to multi-tracks being put off for another week.
- Helped to prepare for a successful beta release by being the primary reviewer for pull requests and helping with integrating the code from separate branches all into main. This took longer than anticipated and led to me being less involved with helping with effects and making the slides than I thought.
- Also helped to fix some bugs with code that was eventually integrated into main to make for a smoother beta demonstration.

#### Plans and goals for the next week:
- Review any current pull requests, offer feedback, and merge with main if everything looks good. Finish by Monday 11/10 EOD, such that there are no pull requests that have no feedback or have not been merged to main.
- Look into how the multi-track feature will work and implement this functionality into a new working branch by the next team meeting on Thursday 11/13.
- Write automated tests for multi-track implementation by Friday 11/14 EOD.
