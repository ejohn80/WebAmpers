## Team Report:

### Last week's goals:
- Create UI designs/mockups to be voted
### Progress and Issues:
- Made multiple UI design prototypes, with iterative feedback from team members
- Set up the project repository + scaffolding
- Implemented user registration and login
- Created Users collection in firestore
- Landing page is very bare
- Still working on tests
### Plans and goals for the next week:
- Finalize UI, start implementation (Zahara)
- Design data states (how data is stored/retrieved/managed) (Jiarong)
- Start implementing file Upload/Delete/Save/Open functionalities (Ethan, Tomas)
- Set up testing/CI (Long)
- Implement audio wave visualization (Yiwen)
- Improve communication server channels (Yiwen)


## Contributions of individual team members:


### Zahara:
#### Progress and Issues:
- Revised hand drawn UI prototype based on team feedback
  - What worked: Team feedback improved design
  - What I learned: Some aspects of the layout needed adjustment, such as moving features around
  - Issues: Design could use better spacing
- Got started on high-fidelity prototype of UI using Figma
  - What worked: Basic layout translates well from paper
#### Plans and goals for the next week:
- Finalize UI mockup on Figma (2-3 days)
- Begin front-end development based on finalized prototype (2 days)
  - Header and navigation components (1 day)
  - Editing page layout (1 day)


### Jiarong:
#### Last week's goals:
-  “It is empty for the first week.”

#### Progress and Issues:
-  Done setting up VSCode
-  Still learning how to make the registration and login endpoints works

#### Plans and goals for the next week:
-  Make sure the registration and login endpoints works (2-3 hours)
-  Set up logic for data states
    - Designing (2h)
    - Implementing (1 day)


### Tomas:
#### Last week's goals:
- Set up the initial project scaffolding
- Work on user registration and login

#### Progress and Issues:
-  Pushed the initial code scaffolding using vite, while also setting up the initial dependencies (react router, tone.js, react-icons, react-spinners, firebase)
- Successfully implemented the registration and login, and tested it briefly. After user account creation, I can see the user data in the firebase console

#### Plans and goals for the next week:
- Implement password recovery (easy) (1h)
- Start progress on UI, and particularly on the main application component (3h)
- Start implementing file Upload/Delete/Save/Open functionalities (6h)
- Look into how to set up connection with a server that runs python (2h)


### Long:
#### Last week's goals:
- “It is empty for the first week.”

#### Progress and Issues:
- Finalizing mock up of Figma design before implementing site.
- Provided feedback on UI such as functionality, suggesting separate pages, and buttons
- Researched proper relevant testing methods to appropriately test expected functionality

#### Plans and goals for the next week:
- Finalizing front-end UI. Expected to finish by the end of week 4.
- Create test login, signup, password recovery. Expected by the end of week 4.
- Include documentation for testing.  Expected to be a living document.
- Test accordingly based on the progression of back-end and front-end. This will be based on the progression of others.


### Yiwen:
#### Last week's goals:
- “It is empty for the first week.”

#### Progress and Issues:
- Suggested alternative UI
    Challenges: Uncertainty of deciding where to put buttons for best user experience. Using existing software as reference for UI was helpful.
- Ensure everyone sets up the project successfully (installing npm and running). 
    Challenges: People miss messages online.
- Created communication channels and set up rules for communication (No issues)
- Assigned tasks to each team member

#### Plans and goals for the next week:
- Finalize UI design (voting, choosing feature designs, decide during team meeting on Tuesday)
- Set up details on the communication server for better organization of projects (setting up bots for deadlines, channels for distributing tasks, etc). By Wednesday 10/15.
- Update project schedule/calendar by Wednesday 10/15.
- Begin implementation of visualizing audiofile waveform UI. ~ by Friday 10/17.
    - Research into relevant APIs (1 day)
    - Implement the display so that it aligns with the layout (requires layout, 1-2 days) 


### Ethan:
#### Last week goals:
- “It is empty for the first week.”

#### Progress and Issues:
- Provided feedback on current UI iterations including questions on the functionality of different parts of the UI (buttons, dropdowns, etc.).
    - I had little experience working with platforms similar to Webamp so I needed to view how current practices handle UI to be able to get a proper perspective on how these things should look. Coming up with ideas that stray away from the norms of these platforms was challenging, but was made easier with the guiding principles of ease of use.
- Completed the setup for the project in VSCode.

#### Plans and goals for the next week:
- Implement the functionality for audio import so that the user can upload an audio file to the website. Finish by Wednesday 10/16, should take about 1-2 days with figuring out how to use JavaScript and Tone.js for this task.
- Ensure that the user uploaded file can be used by the backend and is of the proper file type (mp3 or wav) after a user can upload a file and before the meeting on Thursday 10/16, should only take a day at most.
- Write testing code for user uploads, ensuring that the file is stored if passed the correct file, or that the user is given a warning for an unsupported file type. Finish this by EOD Friday 10/16, may take 1-2 days to figure out testing.
