## Team Report:

### Last week's goals:

- Add the audio modifiers, then implement state handlers for audio effects
- Including buttons on main page
- Finishing playback
- User uploads and save to firebase
- Adding effects (stretch)
- Merging multiple branches
- Stylize header

### Progress and Issues:

- User uploads save to firebase, fetching logic
- Finished main parts of sidebar (projects, assets, effects), not fully connected to the states yet
- Finished playback with positional tracking (vertical line)
- Voice recording
- Finished core logic for how states are saved on browser memory
- Improved UI

### Plans and goals for the next week:

- Debugging and integrating branches for beta
- Implementing state handlers for audio effects
- Finish setting up knob/slider for effect parameters
- Implement functionality for each of the audio effects (could mean manual audio processing or using tone.js API)
- Testing audio effects
- Work on backend to finish a simple export function, maybe file conversion
- Debugging and implementing volume controls

## Contributions of individual team members:

### Zahara:

#### Last Week’s Goals:

- Finalize and refine header and dropdown functionality
- Continue integrating core UI components into layout
- Test and polish user interactions

#### Progress and Issues:

- Dropdown components in header are styled and ready for functionality to be added
- Encountered issue with layering and z-index when dropdown overlaps with other components (solved by using React Portal to render dropdown above other components)

#### Plans and goals for the next week:

- Finalize styling for any audio or playback-related features (1-2 days)
- Make header and dropdown components functional (3 days)
- Discuss finalizing the options in header dropdown with teammates so that it is consistent with our project requirements (1 day)
- Collaborate with teammates to see if any additional UI components are needed for the main content area and design them if so (1 day)
- Finalize footer styling (1 day)

### Jiarong:

#### Last week's goals:

- Integrating Python with the JS code in the audio manager by the end of friday
- Integration with storage like Firebase by the end of the week
  – Upload, Delete, Save, Open/select

#### Progress and Issues:

- Improve the playback functionality required for the website
  - Add a progress bar
- Add volume control
- prepare for the Beta release

#### Plans and goals for the next week:

- Add more features to the website (such as musical instruments, more effects).
- Implement functionality for each of the audio effects

### Tomas:

#### Last week's goals:

- Finish everything with user upload + project saving state (~60% done)
- Work on the header (displaying project name, account settings, project settings…)
- Finish working on the side bar (finishing up the styles, adding effect controls…)

#### Progress and Issues:

- Finished implementing sidebar functionality (projects, assets, effects), not connected to state yet
- Reworked db structure for saving user files in firebase, also had to change firebase authentication rules
- Added application-wide context wrapper
- Started working on integrating effects with state (aka how to save user projects)
- Header is being implemented by Zahara

#### Plans and goals for the next week:

- Work on backend to finish a simple export function, maybe file conversion
- Integrate effects with state (large, high priority task)

### Long (Updated October 27, 2025):

#### Last week's goals:

- Add audio effects
- Look into storing audio files in browser
- Experiment how to change audio track with audio effects

#### Progress and Issues:

- I am no longer working on audio effects.
- Picked up on audio playback from Jiarong
- Fixed scrubbing bugs, moved playback to footer
- Added red line to track where the audio is on the waveform
- Added live recording with live waveforms and waveform on main content page
- Added timestamp of both recording and time lapse of audio track
- Added buttons to play from the beginning, move backwards/forwards 10 seconds.

#### Plans and goals for the next week:

- Finalize Footer UI (Finish before Tuesday for beta)
- Work on the main content page to space audio tracks. (End of week)

### Yiwen:

#### Last week's goals:

- Implementing browser memory storage of data (Wednesday)
- Helping and finishing playback implementation (Thursday)
- Reimplementing waveform rendering so it looks nicer (Friday)

#### Progress and Issues:

- Implemented IndexDB saving. This part might require multiple revamps in the future if we ever need to change how data is stored (adding more fields etc)
- Added a container for displayed waveforms so that waveforms don’t take up the entirety of main content
- Added mute/solo controls (requires debugging)

#### Plans and goals for the next week:

- Final debugging for beta (Tuesday)
- Slides prepping (Tuesday)
- Implementing track specific gain controls (Friday)
- Begin planning how to integrate audio effects (Friday)

### Ethan:

#### Last week goals:

- Finish export and Python/JS integration files along with the testing code, ensuring that all tests pass to be able to submit a pull request before the team meeting on 10/28. Should take another day to completely finish such that a pull request can be made before the team meeting on Tuesday.
- Help with implementation of audio recording so that a user can press the record button and record their audio, resulting in a new audio file being created. Finish by Wednesday 10/29, should take 1-2 days looking into any helpful Tone.js methods and how to save the audio file.
- Write tests for audio recording ensuring that the file is properly saved when the recording ends, that the audio is recorded correctly with no distortions, and that. Finish by EOD Thursday, 10/30, as this should only take 1 day to complete.

#### Progress and Issues:

- Python/JS integration took longer than expected but has been completed, just waiting on deciding how to handle current pull requests across all the different branches to know when to submit a pull request.
- Export code was also made to be functional and passing all the written tests as well as working for manual tests.
- Audio recording was completed by another group member, so I was not involved with that process but it appears to be completed.

#### Plans and goals for the next week:

- Help prepare for a beta release by integrating exporting into the beta release with all of the other features. Assist wherever is necessary according to what is buggy and what has yet to be integrated. To be completed by Tuesday 11/4 EOD.
- Review incoming pull requests for the different feature branches, ensure functionality, passing tests, and resolve any merge conflicts. Ideally, have it done by EOD Monday 11/3 so that the main branch is prepared with all of the current features for the beta release for discussion on Tuesday 11/4.
- Help make slides and potentially the demo for the beta presentation by Tuesday 11/4 EOD.
- Look into more effects to determine what should be added and how to implement them, with the added effects being added by Friday 11/7 EOD.
