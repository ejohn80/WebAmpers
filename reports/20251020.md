- Ensure proper testing for the new features (audio visualization is accurate, playback controls are responsive) (Yiwen, Long)
- Start working on the backend (try to deploy the most basic container on Google Cloud) (Thomas)
- Implement save/delete and interactions to firebase (Thomas, Ethan)
- Implementing audio recording (Ethan)

## Contributions of individual team members:

### Zahara:

#### Last Week’s Goals:

- Revised hand drawn UI prototype based on team feedback
- Got started on high-fidelity prototype of UI using Figma

#### Progress and Issues:

- UI for the main editing page is mostly done and needs some finishing touches
- Experimented with layouts and design choices
- Ran into minor issues with figma interactions

#### Plans and goals for the next week:

- Finalize UI mockup on Figma (2-3 days)
- Begin front-end development based on finalized prototype (2 days)
  - Implement header and navigation components (1 day)
  - Set up sidebar layout
- Organize figma assets and export them for development (1 day)

### Jiarong (10/20/2025):

#### Last week's goals:

- Make sure the registration and login endpoints works
- Set up logic for data states
  - Designing
  - Implementing

#### Progress and Issues:

- Learning tone.js for how to use it to play audio on web
- The final UI and some decisions have not yet been decided, will discuss it on the 21st

#### Plans and goals for the next week:

- Study tone.js and write the code to ensure that our web page can play audio by the end of the week
- Help design version control system with frontend, done by the end of Thursday.

### Tomas:

#### Last week's goals:

- Implement password recovery (easy) (1h)
- Start progress on UI, and particularly on the main application component (3h)
- Start implementing file Upload/Delete/Save/Open functionalities (6h)
- Look into how to set up connection with a server that runs python (2h)

#### Progress and Issues:

- Implemented password recovery
- Did not work on Upload/Delete/Save/Open functionalities since someone else started working on them, I’m planning to finish what they started.
- Did not work on UI as it was still being finalized and a team member volunteered to start the layout work.
- Started looking into setting up a container in Google Cloud that will run a Flask API so that our frontend can call functions that require python (like exporting files/modifying file types).

#### Plans and goals for the next week:

- Finish Upload/Delete/Save/Open functionalities (to actually save it to the database)
- Help with UI (reactful/state components)
- Set up a basic container in Google Cloud, and try to invoke a simple function like print hello world from the front end.

### Long (Updated October 20, 2025):

#### Last week's goals:

- Finalizing front-end UI. Expected to finish by the end of week 4.
- Create test login, signup, password recovery. Expected by the end of week 4.
- Include documentation for testing. Expected to be a living document.
- Test accordingly based on the progression of back-end and front-end. This will be based on the progression of others.

#### Progress and Issues:

- Finalizing front-end UI (Ongoing, other team members are already working on this)
- Create test login, signup, password recovery. (Complete, just need to push to Git)
- Include documentation for testing. Expected to be a living document. (Ongoing since there was a mix-up with the due date on Course website and actual canvas due date.)
- Looked into CI. Decided on testing using ViTest, pytest (tbd) and CI with Github Actions

#### Plans and goals for the next week:

- Test appropriate any features expected to be setup by other team members
- Finish testing documentation (Testing and CI assignment). Documentation includes details for testing and how to use. (End of week)
- Support front-end or begin creating Audio Effects with tone.js. (End of week or moves into the following week)

### Yiwen:

#### Last week's goals:

- Finalize UI design (voting, choosing feature designs, decide during team meeting on Tuesday)
- Set up details on the communication server for better organization of projects (setting up bots for deadlines, channels for distributing tasks, etc). By Wednesday 10/15.
- Update project schedule/calendar by Wednesday 10/15.
- Begin implementation of visualizing audiofile waveform UI. ~ by Friday 10/17.
  - Research into relevant APIs (1 day)
  - Implement the display so that it aligns with the layout (requires layout, 1-2 days)

#### Progress and Issues:

- Drafted code design. I came up with what I could for ideas for how to organize objects and what states we store. Wasn’t confident on the most optimized strategy for storage of user projects and data. We would need a team meeting to further develop this.
- Implemented skeleton UI based on finalized UI structure for audio editor page
- Implemented visualization of audio waveform. Introduced an issue of unsupported file formats (may need to update tests or omit certain files completely).
- Refactored files for better organization and modularity
- Update schedule (unfinished/pushed-back). We lacked organization of clarity on who is doing what. We will try to learn from experience and have it more clearly laid out during the team meeting to have it updated for the code design milestone.
- Communication server set up (dropped). After discussing with the team, we decided that complicated quality of life features for communication will unnecessarily and will likely not be used.

#### Plans and goals for the next week:

- Finalize Design (Tuesday as a team)
- Update schedule/tasks (Tuesday)
- Write more tests for file import in consideration of more supported files (Tuesday)
- Testing audio visualization (Thursday)
- Implement buttons for audio editor (Friday)
  - May include implementation of logic for record/playback
  - Connecting ui components to already implemented logic
  - Discussing ui designs with team members

### Ethan:

#### Last week goals:

- Implement the functionality for audio import so that the user can upload an audio file to the website. Finish by Wednesday 10/16, should take about 1-2 days with figuring out how to use JavaScript and Tone.js for this task.
- Ensure that the user uploaded file can be used by the backend and is of the proper file type (mp3 or wav) after a user can upload a file and before the meeting on Thursday 10/16, should only take a day at most.
- Write testing code for user uploads, ensuring that the file is stored if passed the correct file, or that the user is given a warning for an unsupported file type. Finish this by EOD Friday 10/16, may take 1-2 days to figure out testing.

#### Progress and Issues:

- Finished implementing the functionality for importing audio files, error handling, and writing tests.
- Struggled a little bit with figuring out Firebase interactions when trying to help with file saves and deletions. Might be better to pass this off to the backend developers who are more familiar with Firebase.
- Ended up using Jest for writing tests for AudioImporter but should change to Vitest instead for sake of simplicity and consistency.

#### Plans and goals for the next week:

- Rewrite tests from Jest to Vitest for the AudioImporter such that all the tests still pass and maintain the same functionality. Finish by EOD Tuesday 10/21, and should only take 2 hours at most.
- Help with implementation of audio recording so that a user can press the record button and record their audio, resulting in a new audio file being created. Finish by Wednesday 10/22, should take 1-2 days looking into any helpful Tone.js methods and how to save the audio file.
- Write tests for audio recording ensuring that the file is properly saved when the recording ends, that the audio is recorded correctly with no distortions, and that. Finish by EOD Thursday, 10/23, as this should only take 1 day to complete.
- Look into the live mode feature and help with implementation so that there can be simultaneous recording and playback by EOD Friday 10/24, but may take longer to prevent conflicts between recording and playback, and looking into Tone.js for helpful methods. This task should take 1-2 days to complete.
